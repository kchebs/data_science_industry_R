# data_science_industry_R

The goal of this project was twofold. First, it was to find an interesting dataset with at least 1,000 observations. Then it was to use R to apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. The report format was specificed for a class.

This project analyzes a Kaggle.com survey of data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineeers... to determine industry statistics.

## Getting Started

To simply view the report, open Project.html. To edit or view the code, open Project.rmd.

### Prerequisites

This project requires R programming language. You can download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). It was constructed using the free RStudio software, but you can use other programs if desired.

### Installing

Besides installing the necessary programming language, software, and software packages that are imported in the beginning of the code, no other installation is needed.


Some R packages used are shown below:
* install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = T) 
* install.packages("knitr", dependencies = T)
* install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = T)

## Running the tests

To recreate or to create an .HTML file similar to Project.HTML, use knitr in R to knit the RMD file into an HTML file.

## Further Learning Goals

* Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
* Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
* Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
* Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information
